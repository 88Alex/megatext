MegaText- The Ultimate Text Editor
==================================

MegaText is a new text editor designed to be powerful and modern yet simple to use.

Features
--------

### Tool Integration

MegaText provides integration for a large variety of tools-
everything from compilers and build systems to version control.
And if there isn't integration for your favourite tool,
you can always write an extension yourself!

### Lots of Features

MegaText provides many features to make your life easier- syntax highlighting,
autocompletion, and compilation from within the editor, just to name a few.
Again, as with tool integration, you can always write your own extensions
if you feel something's missing.

### Configurability

MegaText is a very configurable text editor. Almost everything can be
adjusted and configured to the user's preferences.

### Extensibility

MegaText is very extensible, and provides a convenient extension API
for developers to use. Developing useful extensions becomes easy.
And you can share your extensions in the Extension Repository.

### Modularity

MegaText has a very modular design. If you don't like one component,
you can rip it out and make your own. This modularity also makes
developing extensions easy.
